This is a collection of user styles used to alter the appearance of the Twitter websites.  
They can be installed with browser extensions like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html).

## [Twitter Desaturated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperfekt/twitter-styles/master/twitter_desaturated.user.css)
This style desaturates the Twitter Night Mode, entirely removing the blue tint from the site.  
You will have to activate the Night Mode for it to work properly.

## [Twitter Square](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperfekt/twitter-styles/master/twitter_square.user.css)
This style changes the radius of Twitter's avatars and interface elements, making them square,  
optionally with corners rounded to your specification.
